# RPI-I

Final project of the subject "Networks, protocols and interfaces I" (Redes, protocolos e interfaces I) from Master in Computer Science at Complutense University of Madrid, course 2020-2021.

The [final project](./RPI-I_final_project/) consists on a capacity estimation mechanism that integrates air quality monitoring (simulated), as well as connection management to a WiFi network through provisioning of keys via soft-AP. The measured data are exposed to the clients by a Gatt server.

Experiments for determining the *measured power* of an ESP32 can also be found in the [rssi_scan/](./rssi_scan/) folder.
